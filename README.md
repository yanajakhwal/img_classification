### Hello readers and coders! Thanks for taking a look at this repo. I decided to start this project to get my hands on applying machine learning with relevant Python libraries and to also get a deeper understanding of neural networks and deep learning. For my paper, I wrote about Neural Networks, CNNs for Image Classification, and the process and outcomes of applying a CNN to a real dataset with two different frameworks. In order to run the two frameworks (Keras/Tensorflow and Pytorch) please follow the steps below.

## Environment:
- installation: pip install virtualenv
- creating environment: python3 -m venv env
- activate the environment: env\Scripts\activate
- consult https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for any issues

## Install necessary packages and libraries:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- download: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
- drag and drop cifar-10-batches-py and cifar-10-batches.tar into the cifar10_data folder

## Running:
- python src/data.py
- run all of the blocks of code on src/keras_tensorflow.ipynb and src/pytorch.ipynb
- consult the documentation of keras tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras for any issues

## Read about my findings:
